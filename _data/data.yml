career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am currently a computer science student at Ionian University. I really enjoy coding and learning about game and software development 
      which I am keen to persue a career in. I am a hard worker and I enjoy working with other people to complete a project. 

experiences:
           Since I am still an undergraduate student I do not have any experiences. I just try to learn new things so I can create my own 
            projects.
